KEY INSIGHTS
================================================================================

1. CLASS DISTRIBUTION: 
   - Listen rate: 68.40%
   - Skip rate: 31.60%
   - Moderate class imbalance (ratio 0.46:1)

2. DATASET SCALE:
   - 7,558,834 total sessions
   - Large dataset requires efficient processing strategies

3. KEY PREDICTORS:
   - listen_type shows strong correlation with target
   - Platform and context features are important
   - Track duration affects skip behavior

4. MODELING RECOMMENDATIONS:
   - Use stratified sampling for train/val splits
   - Apply class weights in models
   - Feature engineering: user history, popularity, temporal features
   - Consider ensemble methods for best performance

NEXT STEPS:
- Feature engineering and preprocessing pipeline
- Baseline models (logistic regression, random forest)
- Advanced models (XGBoost, LightGBM, neural networks)
- Evaluation framework with proper metrics (AUC, precision, recall)
